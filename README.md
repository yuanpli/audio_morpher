# AudioMorpher - Audio Conversion Tool
AudioMorpher is a command-line tool written in Rust for converting audio files in `m4a` format to `mp3` format. It supports specifying input and output directories and provides a progress bar to show the conversion progress. After the conversion is completed, the program will prompt the user to check the files in the output directory.
## Installation
1. Ensure that your system has the Rust compiler installed. If not, visit [Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and download and install the Rust toolchain according to your operating system.
2. Clone the AudioMorpher project locally and enter the project directory.
3. In the command line, run `cargo build --release` to compile the project. After successful compilation, an executable file named `audiomorpher` will be generated in the `target\release` directory.
## Usage
1. **Batch conversion of files**: If you need to convert all m4a files in a directory, you can enter in the command line: `audiomorpher input directory`. AudioMorpher will automatically scan all m4a files in the specified directory and convert them to mp3 format. The output directory defaults to the `output` folder in the current directory.
2. **View help**: If you need to view help information, you can enter in the command line: `audiomorpher -h`, which will display the help information of the tool, including usage, options, and descriptions.
3. **Example**:
```bash
(base) ï£¿ ~/ audiomorpher "~/folder"
[00:00:10] [########################################] 21/21 (100%)
Conversion completed. Please open /Users/output to view the converted files.
```
